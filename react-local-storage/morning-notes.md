# React Local Storage

if we refresh browsers, the previous made changes on the website should be saved even if the window/application is closed.

## cookies... ;)

- act on the server side!!!
- each browser gives us the option to store the changes on the users browsers

## session storage and local storage

- client-side
- never save sensitive data!
- this is only client-side, but still if you save other people's user data then only stuff like dark mode

--> set, retrieve and delete

## session storage

- only available for the time the application is open
- includes browser refresh, closing/oping tab
- BUT NOT quittting the browser application!

## local storage

- available until the browser cache is being deleted

--------- EXAMPLE -----------

```js

```

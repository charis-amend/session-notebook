# What is a server

### executing JS in RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT

- in dev console or terminal:
  `node`
  `4+5`
  // logs 9
- with nodeJS i can write js

## difference between node and dev console:

- in dev console browser you can access a DOM element like "document" object or "window" object
- but:
- in node Terminal...
- we dont have "document" object
